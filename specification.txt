# Frontend Specs – Todo App Phase II

Purpose:
- Provide user interface for authentication, task CRUD, filtering, and sorting.
- Use Better Auth for signup/signin and JWT management.
- Built with Next.js 16+ App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure only authenticated users can access tasks.

Pages:
- /signup → displays Better Auth signup form, redirects to /tasks after signup
- /signin → displays Better Auth signin form, redirects to /tasks after login
- /tasks → displays TaskList + TaskForm, supports filtering & sorting, auth required
- /tasks/[id] → displays single TaskCard with edit/delete/complete actions, only owner can access

UI Components:
- Auth Components:
  - SignUpForm: uses Better Auth (name, email, password)
  - SignInForm: uses Better Auth (email, password)
  - AuthGuard: protects private routes using Better Auth JWT

- Task Components:
  - TaskCard: shows title, description, status, created/updated date
  - TaskForm: create or update task
  - TaskList: displays TaskCards, supports filtering and sorting
  - CompleteToggle: toggle completion of task

- Layout Components:
  - Navbar: user info from Better Auth + logout button
  - Footer: copyright and info

Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS for professional, responsive styling
- Ensure consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Forms and buttons must have hover/focus effects
- TaskCard visually indicates completed vs pending tasks

Rules:
- Validate form inputs before submission
- Display success and error messages for all actions
- Only authenticated users can access task pages
- Integrate fully with Next.js 16+ App Router (use server components if needed)
- JWT token from Better Auth included in Authorization header for backend calls
