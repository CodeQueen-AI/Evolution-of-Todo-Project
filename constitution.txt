## 🔹 Constitution: Todo App – Phase III (AI-Powered Todo Chatbot) **[Updated]**

### Purpose

This constitution defines the principles, rules, and constraints for **Phase III** of the Todo application.
The goal is to evolve the Phase II full-stack web app into an **AI-powered conversational Todo chatbot** using **spec-driven development**, where the chatbot UI is built using **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**, and connects to a **FastAPI AI backend**.


### Core Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development Only**

   * No chatbot, AI, or MCP feature may be implemented without a written specification.
   * Gemini CLI must generate all implementation code.
   * Manual coding is **not allowed**.

2. **Custom Frontend UI (No ChatKit)**

   * Chat UI must be built using **Next.js 16+ App Router** and **Tailwind CSS**.
   * No OpenAI ChatKit or prebuilt chatbot UI libraries may be used.
   * Frontend only handles UI and user interaction.

3. **AI as an Interface, Not Logic**

   * AI does not contain business logic.
   * All task logic lives in MCP tools and backend services.
   * AI only interprets intent and invokes tools.

4. **Stateless Backend Architecture**

   * FastAPI backend must remain stateless.
   * Conversation state must be stored in the database.
   * Server restarts must not affect chat continuity.

5. **User Ownership & Security**

   * All chatbot interactions require JWT authentication (Better Auth).
   * AI can only act on tasks belonging to the authenticated user.

6. **Tool-Driven AI Behavior**

   * AI can interact with the system **only via MCP tools**.
   * Direct database access by AI is forbidden.

### Scope of Phase III

**Included**

* Custom chat UI using Next.js + Tailwind CSS
* FastAPI AI chat backend
* OpenAI Agents SDK
* Official MCP SDK
* Natural language todo management
* Persistent conversations

**Excluded**

* ChatKit
* Kubernetes
* Kafka / Dapr
* Voice input


### Success Criteria

Phase III is complete when:

* Users chat via a custom Next.js UI
* Messages are sent to FastAPI backend
* AI manages tasks via MCP tools
* Conversation persists after refresh
* JWT auth & user isolation enforced
* All code generated via specs



### Non-Negotiable Rules

* Specs are the source of truth
* Gemini CLI only
* No ChatKit
* MCP tools only
